# CreateSheetWithContacts-
Applescript to create a Numbers sheet from a defined contacts group. To be used with 'Pages Data Merge'.

I have a group of contacts (students) for which I want to make Bills in Pdf documents and send them with mail.
The first step is to create a NUmbers document with the data. The next step is to create by hand a Pages document containing the (merge) fields. The last step is to use the application ['Pages Data Merge'](https://iworkautomation.com/pages/script-tags-data-merge.html)
